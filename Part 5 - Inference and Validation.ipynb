    "# Inference and Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have a trained network, you can use it for making predictions. This is typically called **inference**, a term borrowed from statistics. However, neural networks have a tendency to perform *too well* on the training data and aren't able to generalize to data that hasn't been seen before. This is called **overfitting** and it impairs inference performance. To test for overfitting while training, we measure the performance on data not in the training set called the **validation** dataset. We avoid overfitting through regularization such as dropout while monitoring the validation performance during training. In this notebook, I'll show you how to do this in PyTorch. \n",

    "## Building the network\n",
    "\n",
    "As with MNIST, each image in Fashion-MNIST is 28x28 which is a total of 784 pixels, and there are 10 classes. I'm going to get a bit more advanced here, I want to be able to build a network with an arbitrary number of hidden layers. That is, I want to pass in a parameter like `hidden_layers = [512, 256, 128]` and the network is contructed with three hidden layers have 512, 256, and 128 units respectively. To do this, I'll use `nn.ModuleList` to allow for an arbitrary number of hidden layers. Using `nn.ModuleList` works pretty much the same as a normal Python list, except that it registers each hidden layer `Linear` module properly so the model is aware of the layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The issue here is I need a way to define each `nn.Linear` module with the appropriate layer sizes. Since each `nn.Linear` operation needs an input size and an output size, I need something that looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Create ModuleList and add input layer\n",
    "hidden_layers = nn.ModuleList([nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_layers[0])])\n",
    "# Add hidden layers to the ModuleList\n",
    "hidden_layers.extend([nn.Linear(h1, h2) for h1, h2 in layer_sizes])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Getting these pairs of input and output sizes can be done with a handy trick using `zip`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "hidden_layers = [512, 256, 128, 64]\n",
    "layer_sizes = zip(hidden_layers[:-1], hidden_layers[1:])\n",
    "for each in layer_sizes:\n",
    "    print(each)\n",
    "\n",
    ">> (512, 256)\n",
    ">> (256, 128)\n",
    ">> (128, 64)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "I also have the `forward` method returning the log-softmax for the output. Since softmax is a probability distibution over the classes, the log-softmax is a log probability which comes with a [lot of benefits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log_probability). Using the log probability, computations are often faster and more accurate. To get the class probabilities later, I'll need to take the exponential (`torch.exp`) of the output. Algebra refresher... the exponential function is the inverse of the log function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\large{e^{\\ln{x}} = x }$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can include dropout in our network with [`nn.Dropout`](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/nn.html#dropout). This works similar to other modules such as `nn.Linear`. It also takes the dropout probability as an input which we can pass as an input to the network."
